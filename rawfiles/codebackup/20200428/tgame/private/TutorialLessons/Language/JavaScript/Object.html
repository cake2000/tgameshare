    Before continuing with the tutorial, let's have a review on the concept of <b>object</b> in JavaScript.
  </p>
  <p>
    An <b>object</b> is used to represent a real-world object, such as a car or a movie, in the computer world. 
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="/images/redcar2seats.jpg" style="width: 70%; height: auto; margin-left: 15%; vertical-align: top;"/>
  </p>  
  <p>
    Just as we describe a real-world object using specific attributes (properties) such as color and shape, a JavaScript object also has its own properties. Each property is associated with a corresponding value, and a "<span class="variablenamebold">:</span>" is expected between the property name and value. For example, when we describe a car by saying that "its color is red and it has two seats", we can represent that car with a JavaScript object with two properties:
  </p>
  <pre class="brush: js">
car = {         // start of object definition
  color: "red", // a comma is needed between properties
  seatCount: 2  // properties can span multiple lines
};              // end of object definition
  </pre>
  <p>
    Note that <b>an object starts with "{" and ends with "}", with properties separated by commas (,)</b>. 
  </p>    
</element>

  <p>
    <b>Behavior</b> is more about what the object can do. When a car <b>runs</b>, its position is changed as a result. Some behaviors are more abstract. For example, a movie can <b>rename</b> itself by changing its title. These behaviors can be represented in JavaScript as <b>method functions</b> attached to the object like this:
  </p>
  <pre class="brush: js">
let car = {
  color: "red",
  seatCount: 2,
  // define behavior as part of object creation
  run: function() {
    // change position of car
  }
};
// trigger a method
car.run();

let movie = {
  title: "Frozen",
  length: 120
};            
// attach new behavior to object 
movie.rename = function(newTitle) {
  this.title = newTitle;
};
  </pre>  
</element-->

<element elementid="110" elementType="Info">
  <p>You can read or write object properties in two ways:</p>
  <pre class="brush: js">
objectName.propertyName
  </pre>
  <p>or</p>
  <pre class="brush: js">
objectName["propertyName"]
  </pre>
  <p>
    So for our car object, you can read or change its color using <b>car.color</b> or <b>car["color"]</b>.
  </p>
</element>


<element elementid="120" elementType="Info">
  <p>There are a couple of key facts to remember about objects:
    <ul>
      <li>
        An object can be empty, as represented by {}. 
      </li>
      <li>
        You can modify an object's properties:
        <pre class="brush: js">
car.color = "blue";
        </pre>
      </li>
      <!--li>
        It's perfectly fine for an object to have no method function defined, as we often just need to store some attributes in an object.
      </li-->
      <li>
        The value of a property can be another object itself. For example, we can add a property "wheel" to the car object, and the wheel object can be have 2 properties of its own: "diameter" and "color":
        <pre class="brush: js">
car.wheel = {
    diameter: 17, color: "silver"
};
        </pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
