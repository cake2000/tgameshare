        Terms of Services
      </h2>

        Respect the law, respect the others.

    <p>
      TuringGame refers to the web application at www.tgame.ai created and maintained by Uplifting Technology, Inc, and the terms of services apply to both TuringGame and Uplifting Technology, Inc.

      TuringGame provides its service to you subject to the following terms and conditions (the "Terms of Service"). TuringGame may also offer other services that are governed separately by their own Terms of Service.
      </p>










      <br/>
      <br/>

      <h4>
Services
      </h4>
      <br/>
      <br/>

      <p>
      </p>



TuringGame provides a collection of content, resources, tools, and technologies that enable users to enjoy online games and learn about artificial intelligence at the same time. You understand and agree that the Service is provided <b>AS-IS</b> and that TuringGame does not assume any liability for personal information stored through our Service. You accept that the Service may include advertisements. TuringGame reserves the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof) with or without notice. You agree that TuringGame shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Service.
      <br/>
      <br/>



      <h4>
Registration
      </h4>
      <br/>
      <br/>

      <p>
In consideration of your use of the Service, you agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Service's registration form and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or if TuringGame has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, TuringGame has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service. TuringGame is concerned about the safety and privacy of all its users, particularly children. For this reason, parents, guardians, or school officials of children under the age of 13 who wish to allow their children or students access to the Service must create an account that is maintained by a legal guardian or school representative of at least 18 years old and monitor the child's usage. By allowing a child access to their account, you also give your child permission to access all areas of the Service. Please remember that the Service is designed to appeal to a broad audience. Accordingly, as the legal guardian or school representative, it is your responsibility to determine whether any of the Service areas and/or Content are appropriate for your child.
      </p>

      <br/>

      <h4>
Member Accounts
      </h4>
      <br/>
      <br/>

      <p>
While many portions of the Service do not require registration, you may register as a user of TuringGame to enjoy greater access or privileges. If you choose to register, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password and account and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your password or account. You agree to (a) immediately notify TuringGame of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session. TuringGame cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to protect your account.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
You acknowledge, consent and agree that TuringGame may access, preserve and disclose your account information and Content if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process; (b) enforce the TOS; (c) respond to claims that any Content violates the rights of third parties; (d) respond to your requests for customer service; or (e) protect the rights, property or personal safety of TuringGame, its users and the public.
