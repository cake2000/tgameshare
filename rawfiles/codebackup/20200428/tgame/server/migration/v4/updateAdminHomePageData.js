      Combat games are the best venue for practice coding and applying AI algorithms. That's why Google's DeepMind team developped the <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/" target="_blank">AlphaGo</a> robot to research AI techniques, and <a href="" target="_blank">OpenAI</a> explores artificial general intelligence using arcade games.
    </p>
    <p>
      At our TuringGame platform, we help players <b>build their own "AlphaGo"</b>, and experience the challenge and excitement of building their own game bots that can even beat human players. This is done by carefully redesigning classic combat games to be more fair for both human and robot players, and by providing easy-to-follow tutorials to guide players through the process of building and improving their robots. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We have just started on this journey, and we would love to hear your feedback. Don't hesitate to drop us a <a href="/contact-us" target="_blank">message</a> at any time!

  //     AI (Artificial Intelligence) is an extremely powerful tool, but not many people truly understand the strengths and limitations of AI. People need to realize that AI can accomplish certain tasks faster and better than human beings, and learn to employ AI solutions in those situations. That change in mindset will not only boost our productivity substantially, but also free up our own minds for more challenging and interesting endeavors. 
  //   </p>
  //   <p>
  //     The world will not enter the era of AI until its people fully embrace the power of AI. We are working on it.

      Learning to code can be hard and tedious, especially when the project size grows and more complex logical thinking is required. But we seldom hear kids complaining about how hard it is to play a video game, do we? That's why it is crucial to have really fun coding projects for kids to work on.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are not the first to propose using video games as a teaching platform, but we have a unique approach. By making coding fun again, we aim to attract more kids to understand and enjoy coding.
